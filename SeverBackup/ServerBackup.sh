# Program:
#   This program is create for linux server administrator to backup
#   data which include service configuration, mysql raw data, and web project etc.
# Principle:
#   The data that should be backup will be packaged by this script use tar command and will be saved under /tmp.
#   The next step is copy backup data from /tmp to nfs share directGetting the first field and fourth field of Server ip address and save in HOST parameter.ory, which is designed to backup data saving under the remote backup server.
